# PHASE 14 — PLATFORM-WIDE PRODUCTION READINESS, RELIABILITY, SECURITY HARDENING, PRIVACY ENGINEERING, PERFORMANCE, OBSERVABILITY, BACKGROUND JOBS, CACHING, INFRASTRUCTURE, DEPLOYMENT, BACKUP, DISASTER RECOVERY & COST CONTROL

# Phase Objective

Transform Interview Explainer V2 from a collection of product systems into a platform that can run:

* reliably,
* securely,
* privately,
* observably,
* efficiently,
* recoverably,
* and affordably.

The platform must support:

```text
PUBLIC CONTENT
      +
AUTHENTICATED USER SYSTEMS
      +
PRACTICE
      +
MOCK INTERVIEWS
      +
RESUME PROCESSING
      +
JOB INTELLIGENCE
      +
REAL INTERVIEW INTELLIGENCE
      +
AI WORKLOADS
      +
BACKGROUND PROCESSING
      +
SEO TRAFFIC
```

without each system independently reinventing:

```text
AUTHENTICATION
AUTHORIZATION
RATE LIMITING
CACHING
RETRIES
QUEUES
LOGGING
METRICS
TRACING
ERROR HANDLING
BACKUPS
DEPLOYMENT
SECRETS
COST CONTROLS
```

The central architecture should become:

```text

      ↓
SHARED APPLICATION PLATFORM
      ↓
SHARED DATA PLATFORM
      ↓
SHARED ASYNC PROCESSING
      ↓
SHARED OBSERVABILITY

# Phase 14 Core Principle

Do not build:

```text
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE
      =
MORE RELIABILITY
```

Build:

```text
SIMPLE ARCHITECTURE
      +
CLEAR FAILURE BOUNDARIES
      +
OBSERVABILITY
      +
RECOVERY
      +
TESTED BACKUPS
      +
SECURITY
      +
COST CONTROL
      =
PRODUCTION READINESS
```

# Critical Rule for Interview Explainer V2

Interview Explainer is currently not a hyperscale platform.

Therefore:

```text
DO NOT PREMATURELY BUILD:

20 MICROSERVICES
KUBERNETES
MULTI-REGION ACTIVE-ACTIVE
COMPLEX SERVICE MESH
LARGE DATA PLATFORM
ENTERPRISE EVENT BUS
EXPENSIVE OBSERVABILITY STACK
```

Instead:

```text
MODULAR APPLICATION
      +
CLEAR DOMAIN BOUNDARIES
      +
RELIABLE DATABASE
      +
OBJECT STORAGE
      +
CACHE ONLY WHERE NEEDED
      +
QUEUE FOR REAL ASYNC WORK
      +
STRUCTURED LOGGING
      +
BASIC METRICS + ALERTS
      +
TESTED BACKUPS
      +
REPRODUCIBLE DEPLOYMENT
```

This should be the V2 baseline.

---

# Current Hosting Reality

Because Interview Explainer may initially continue running through:

```text
LOCAL MACHINE
      +
CLOUDFLARE TUNNEL
      +
PUBLIC DOMAIN
```

the temporary architecture must be treated as a real deployment system rather than an informal development setup.

Required:

```text
MACHINE BOOTS
      ↓
APPLICATION STARTS
      ↓
DATABASE / DEPENDENCIES START
      ↓
TUNNEL STARTS
      ↓
HEALTH CHECK PASSES
      ↓
EXTERNAL MONITOR CONFIRMS AVAILABILITY
```

On failure:

```text
PROCESS CRASH
      ↓
AUTO-RESTART

TUNNEL CRASH
      ↓
AUTO-RESTART

MACHINE RESTART
      ↓
SERVICES RETURN AUTOMATICALLY

WEBSITE UNREACHABLE
      ↓
EXTERNAL ALERT

REPEATED FAILURE
      ↓
MANUAL INVESTIGATION
```

This is acceptable as an early low-cost deployment only if the limitations are explicit.

It must not be mistaken for:

```text
HIGH-AVAILABILITY PRODUCTION HOSTING
```

The architecture should therefore define a migration trigger such as:

```text
TRAFFIC GROWTH
OR
REVENUE
OR
RELIABILITY REQUIREMENT
OR
TEAM DEPENDENCY
OR
USER DATA CRITICALITY
      ↓
MIGRATE TO MANAGED HOSTING
```

---

# Root-Level Reliability Rule

If the site repeatedly crashes:

```text
DO NOT
JUST ADD A RESTART SCRIPT.
```

Fix:

```text
ROOT CAUSE
+
HEALTH CHECK
+
AUTO-RECOVERY
+
ALERTING
```

If APIs are slow:

```text
DO NOT
ADD CACHE EVERYWHERE.
```

Fix:

```text
MEASUREMENT
+
QUERY ANALYSIS
+
OVER-FETCHING
+
DATABASE INDEXING
+
ARCHITECTURE
```

Then cache where justified.

If AI is expensive:

```text
DO NOT
ONLY SWITCH TO A CHEAPER MODEL.
```

Fix:

```text
MODEL ROUTING
+
CONTEXT SIZE
+
REGENERATION
+
CACHING
+
OUTPUT LENGTH
+
FEATURE VALUE
```

If production deployment is risky:

```text
DO NOT
ADD MORE MANUAL CHECKLISTS
WITHOUT AUTOMATION.
```

Fix:

```text
REPRODUCIBLE BUILD
+
CI GATES
+
MIGRATION SAFETY
+
HEALTH VALIDATION
+
ROLLBACK
```

If backups exist:

```text
DO NOT ASSUME
DATA IS RECOVERABLE.
```

A backup is operationally useful only after:

```text
BACKUP
      ↓
VERIFY
      ↓
RESTORE
      ↓
MEASURE
```

The exact technologies must be chosen after the repository and runtime audit.

The architecture document must not prematurely lock the project into infrastructure that the current product does not need.
